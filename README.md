# Cryptocurrencies

The objective of this analysis is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market, additionally, the cryptocurrencies will need to be grouped together to create a classification system. The data itself is not ideal for use in a traditional data frame and visualization framework as there is no known output for what we are looking for. The end result should be to have the data neatly packaged in an interesting and comprehensive visualization, to achieve that end we will group the cryptocurrencies in a clustering algorithm. The first step would be to preprocess the data for PCA, then reducing the data dimensions using PCA. Finally, we would cluster the cryptocurrencies using K-means and then with the remaining cleaned data, create a visualization framework suitable for presentation.
